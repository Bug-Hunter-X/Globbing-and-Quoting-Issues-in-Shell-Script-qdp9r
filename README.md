This repository demonstrates a common error in shell scripting involving globbing and quoting. The `bug.sh` script attempts to process files in a directory but fails when filenames contain spaces or special characters.  The solution (`bugSolution.sh`) shows how to correctly handle these cases using proper quoting techniques to prevent word splitting and globbing issues.  The improved script utilizes safer approaches to avoid unexpected behavior and ensure robustness when dealing with variable filenames.
